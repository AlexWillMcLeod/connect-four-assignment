# Connect Four Assignment

University of Auckland assignment for Computer Science 130 with an A+ grade.
Built a connect four game with python, using the <a href="https://github.com/python-eel/Eel" target="_blank">eel</a> ui library.

Play the game by running
`python3 AssCool.py`

Select your board size, which must be an integer greater than 5. There is no software-defined upper limit, the user will just have to scroll.
If your board size is less than five, or alternatively not an integer, a small error will appear in the corner:

Then compete against the computer to see how many you can get in a row before the board is full.
